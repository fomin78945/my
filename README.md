# How Mutual Funds Work
WHAT THEY ARE
A mutual fund is a company that pools money from many investors and
invests the money in stocks, bonds, short-term money-market instruments, other securities or assets, or some combination of these investments. The combined holdings the mutual fund owns are known as its
portfolio. Each share represents an investor’s proportionate ownership
of the fund’s holdings and the income those holdings generate.

CHARACTERISTICS OF FUNDS
Some of the traditional, distinguishing characteristics of mutual funds
include the following:
➣ Investors purchase mutual fund shares from the fund itself (or through
a broker for the fund) instead of from other investors on a secondary
market, such as the NewYork Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Stock Market.
➣ The price that investors pay for mutual fund shares is the fund’s per share
net asset value (NAV) plus any shareholder fees that the fund imposes at
the time of purchase (such as sales loads).
➣ Mutual fund shares are “redeemable,” meaning investors can sell their
shares back to the fund (or to a broker acting for the fund).
➣ Mutual funds generally create and sell new shares to accommodate new
investors. In other words, it sells its shares on a continuous basis, although
some funds stop selling when, for example, they become too large.
➣ The investment portfolios of mutual funds typically are managed by separate
entities known as “investment advisers” that are registered with the SEC.
ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES
Every investment has advantages and disadvantages. But it’s important
to remember that features that matter to one investor may not be important to you. Whether any particular feature is an advantage for you
will depend on your unique circumstances. For some investors, mutual
funds provide an attractive investment choice because they generally
offer the following features:
•	 Professional Management—Professional money managers research,
select,and monitor the performance of the securities the fund purchases.
•	 Diversification—Diversification is an investing strategy that can be
neatly summed up as “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.” Spreading
your investments across a wide range of companies and industry sectors
can help lower your risk if a company or sector fails. Some investors find
it easier to achieve diversification through ownership of mutual funds
rather than through ownership of individual stocks or bonds.
•	 Affordability—Some mutual funds accommodate investors who don’t
have a lot of money to invest by setting relatively low dollar amounts for
initial purchases, subsequent monthly purchases, or both.
•	 Liquidity—Mutual fund investors can readily redeem their sharesat the current NAV—plus any fees and charges assessed on redemption—at any time.
But mutual funds also have features that some investors might view as
disadvantages, such as:
•	 Costs Despite Negative Returns—Investors must pay sales charges,
annual fees, and other expenses (which we discuss in detail on page 13)
regardless of how the fund performs.And, depending on the timing of
their investment, investors may also have to pay taxes on any capital gains
distribution they receive—even if the fund went on to perform poorly
after they bought shares.
•	 Lack of Control—Investors typically cannot ascertain the exact make-up
ofafund’s portfolio atany given time,nor can they directly influence which
securities the fund manager buys and sells or the timing of those trades.
•	 Price Uncertainty—With an individual stock,you can obtain real-time
(or close to real-time) pricing information with relative ease by checking
financial websites or by calling your broker. You can also monitor how a
stock’s price changes from hour to hour—or even second to second. By
contrast, with a mutual fund, the price at which you purchase or redeem
shares will typically depend on the fund’s NAV, which the fund might
not calculate until many hours after you’ve placed your order.In general,
mutual funds must calculate their NAV at least once every business day,
typically after the major U.S. exchanges close.
